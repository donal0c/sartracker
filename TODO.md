## üí° FEATURE ENHANCEMENTS DISCUSSED

### CalTopo Feature Parity Notes
- Team is familiar with CalTopo interface
- **Key requirement:** All coordinate inputs should support BOTH formats:
  - Irish Grid (ITM) - Easting/Northing
  - WGS84 - Latitude/Longitude
- Right-click menu on map for quick access to tools (future enhancement)
- CalTopo reference image: `-5902411506232970001_120.jpg`

### POI/Casualty Management
- [ ] **Identify Tool** - Click on POI/Casualty to see details in popup
  - Show all info (name, type, coordinates, notes, timestamp)
  - Edit button (modify details)
  - Delete button (remove marker)
- [ ] **POI/Casualty List Panel** - Show all markers in a table
  - Sort by name, type, time added
  - Click to zoom to marker
  - Filter by type
  - Bulk delete

### Mission Management
- [ ] **Mission History** - List of past missions
- [ ] **Mission Notes** - Add timestamped notes during mission
- [ ] **Team Assignment** - Assign devices to teams/groups
- [ ] **Device Grouping** - Group devices by team in device list

### Map Improvements
- [ ] **Basemap Selector** - Easy switching between:
  - OpenStreetMap
  - OSi Irish Topographic (if API key available)
  - Bing Aerial
  - Offline/None
- [ ] **Search Location** - Search by placename or grid reference
- [ ] **Quick Zoom Presets** - Save favorite zoom extents
- [ ] **Measurement History** - Keep history of distances measured

### UI Polish
- [ ] **Better color scheme** - Irish Mountain Rescue themed colors
- [ ] **Custom icon** - Replace default plug icon with SAR-appropriate icon
- [ ] **Better button icons** - Add icons to all buttons
- [ ] **Status indicators** - Visual feedback for connection, data loading, etc.

## üîÆ FUTURE (Requires Database Setup)

### Database Migration
- [ ] **Install PostgreSQL/PostGIS** on team's laptop
- [ ] **Create database schema** (already designed in spec)
- [ ] **Modify Eamon's Python scripts** to write to database instead of CSV
- [ ] **Create PostGISProvider** in plugin to read from database
- [ ] **Test database connection** over Zerotier VPN
- [ ] **Handle connection drops gracefully** (offline queue)

### Live Tracking (Database-Powered)
- [ ] **Real-time updates** from Traccar database

- [ ] **Persistent POIs/Casualties** (saved to database)
- [ ] **Persistent Search Areas** (saved to database)
- [ ] **Mission history playback** from historical data
- [ ] **Multi-operator support** (multiple QGIS instances viewing same mission)

### Offline Mode
- [ ] **Offline write queue** - Queue POI/Casualty/Area saves when connection lost
- [ ] **Auto-sync on reconnect** - Sync queued items when connection restored
- [ ] **Offline indicator** - Show clear status when offline
- [ ] **Last known positions** - Show stale data with timestamp when offline

## üêõ KNOWN ISSUES / LIMITATIONS

### Current Limitations
- POIs and Casualties are **memory-only** (lost when QGIS closes)
  - Will be fixed when database is set up
- No way to edit or delete individual POIs/Casualties once added
  - Need to add Identify tool
- No way to save Search Areas yet (Phase 3 feature)
- CSV loading dialog is confusing (folder first, then file)
  - Could improve UX

### Fixed Issues
- ‚úÖ Layer flickering when dragging layers
- ‚úÖ Status bar coordinate display shaking
- ‚úÖ POIs hidden behind tracking layers
- ‚úÖ Map zoom jumping on every refresh
- ‚úÖ Plugin icon not showing in toolbar

```

### Testing Notes
- Plugin works with both single CSV files and folders of CSVs
- Tested with 4 devices (Team Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, EOC)
- Coordinate conversion (Irish Grid ‚Üî WGS84) working correctly
- Mission controls (start/pause/resume/finish) all functional
- Auto-refresh timer working (tested at 10s and 30s intervals)

## üéØ PRIORITY ORDER (Suggested)

1. ‚úÖ ~~**Finish Phase 1 & 2**~~ - COMPLETE!
2. **Phase 3** (CalTopo tools: Lines, Sectors, Search Areas, GPX Import) - Core operational features
3. **UI Polish** - Make it look professional for the team (colors, icons, tooltips)
4. **POI/Casualty Identify Tool** - Make markers interactive (edit/delete)
5. **Phase 4** (Map Export, Reports) - Professional output
6. **Database Setup** - Move from CSV to live database

**Remember:** Keep features simple and reliable. Non-GIS users need to operate this in stressful SAR situations.
