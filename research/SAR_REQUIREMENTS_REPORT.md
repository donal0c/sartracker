# Search & Rescue (SAR) Requirements Report

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Purpose:** Comprehensive analysis of SAR mapping requirements and standards to ensure critical features are not missing from the SAR Tracker QGIS plugin

---

## Executive Summary

Based on research of international SAR standards, existing SAR software platforms, and analysis of the current SAR Tracker implementation, this report identifies critical requirements for SAR mapping applications. While direct access to some official SAR documentation was limited, sufficient information was gathered from multiple sources including IAMSAR guidelines, ICS standards, CalTopo/SARTopo analysis, and examination of open-source SAR tools.

**Key Findings:**
- The SAR Tracker plugin already implements many core features (device tracking, POI/Casualty markers, coordinate conversion)
- Phase 3 planning shows good alignment with CalTopo-style drawing tools
- Several critical SAR-specific features should be considered for implementation
- Terminology should be standardized to match international SAR conventions
- Lost Person Behavior (LPB) integration would significantly enhance search planning capabilities
