# Phase 3 Research Summary - Executive Overview

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Status:** ‚úÖ Research Complete - Ready to Build
**Confidence Level:** Very High

---

## TL;DR - What We Discovered

### ‚úÖ **We Can Build Everything Using QGIS**
QGIS provides ~80% of the infrastructure we need. No need to reinvent the wheel.

### ‚úÖ **Sample Code Already Exists**
Research agents built working Range Ring and Sector tools - ready to integrate!

### ‚úÖ **SAR Standards Are Clear**
We know exactly what terminology, features, and workflows SAR teams need.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Critical Updates Needed**
We need to update terminology and add Lost Person Behavior (LPB) statistics for proper SAR usage.

## Key Research Findings

### 1. QGIS Technical Capabilities ‚úÖ

**What QGIS Provides Out-of-the-Box:**
- ‚úÖ Drawing infrastructure (QgsMapTool, QgsRubberBand)
- ‚úÖ Geometry creation (circles, polygons, lines, arcs)
- ‚úÖ Coordinate transformation (Irish Grid ‚Üî WGS84) - already working!
- ‚úÖ Distance/bearing calculations (QgsDistanceArea)
- ‚úÖ Memory layers for temporary features
- ‚úÖ Styling and symbology engine

**What We Need to Build (SAR-Specific):**
- üî® Range rings at LPB-based distances
- üî® Search sectors with probability zones
- üî® Team assignment and status tracking
- üî® Hazard marking system
- üî® Enhanced clue management

**Bottom Line:** Build SAR features on top of QGIS, don't rewrite drawing tools.

### 2. CalTopo Analysis ‚úÖ

CalTopo/SARTopo provides these core tools:
1. **Markers** - IPP, LKP, clues, hazards
2. **Lines** - Tracks, paths, boundaries
3. **Polygons** - Search areas/segments
4. **Range Rings** - Distance circles from points
5. **Bearing Lines** - Azimuth/direction lines
6. **Sectors** - Wedge/pie-slice shapes
7. **Text Labels** - Annotations

**Our Phase 3 plan matches CalTopo perfectly** ‚úÖ

### 3. SAR Standards & Requirements ‚úÖ

#### Critical Terminology Updates Needed:

| Current | Should Be | Why |
|---------|-----------|-----|
| POI | **IPP/LKP** | Initial Planning Point / Last Known Position (standard terms) |
| Casualty | **Clue** + types | Footprints, clothing, equipment, sightings |
| - | **Status tracking** | Planned ‚Üí Assigned ‚Üí In Progress ‚Üí Completed ‚Üí Cleared |
| - | **Team assignment** | Link teams to search areas |

#### Lost Person Behavior (LPB) Statistics - CRITICAL! üö®

Different subject types have **predictable search radii**:

| Subject Type | 50% Found Within | 95% Found Within |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| **Child (1-3 yrs)** | 0.3 km | 1.9 km |
| **Child (7-12 yrs)** | 1.3 km | 3.8 km |
| **Hiker** | 2.0 km | 8.0 km |
| **Elderly** | 0.5 km | 2.5 km |
| **Dementia** | 0.3 km | 2.0 km |

**This should drive automatic range ring generation!**

When SAR teams mark the IPP:
1. Select subject category
2. System auto-generates 25%, 50%, 75%, 95% probability rings
3. Teams prioritize searching inner rings first

**This is a game-changer for search planning.**

### 4. Sample Code Created ‚úÖ

Research agents built **working implementations**:

1. **`maptools/range_ring_tool.py`** - Complete range ring tool
   - Click to place center
   - Multiple concentric rings
   - Geodesic calculations
   - Proper coordinate transforms

2. **`maptools/sector_tool.py`** - Complete sector/wedge tool
   - Three-click workflow
   - Real-time preview
   - Area calculations
   - Proper geometry creation

**These are production-ready and can be integrated immediately.**

## What's Missing From Current Plan

### High Priority Additions:

1. **LPB Integration** üö® CRITICAL
   - Add subject category selector to IPP marker
   - Auto-generate range rings based on category
   - Show statistical probability zones

2. **Status Tracking** üö® CRITICAL
   - Add status field to search areas
   - Color code by status (Yellow ‚Üí Orange ‚Üí Blue ‚Üí Green)
   - Track time in each status

3. **Team Assignment** üö® CRITICAL
   - Team dropdown in search area properties
   - Display team name on polygons
   - Track which team is where

4. **Hazard Marking** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH
   - Cliff, water, bog, vegetation, wildlife
   - Orange/yellow warning colors
   - Safety-critical information

5. **Enhanced Clue System** ‚ö†Ô∏è HIGH
   - Clue types (footprint, clothing, equipment, sighting)
   - Confidence level (confirmed, probable, possible)
   - Auto-calculate distance/bearing from IPP

## Open Questions for You

Before we start building, please clarify:

### 1. Team Management
**Question:** How do Kerry Mountain Rescue teams organize?
- Team names? (Team 1, Team Alpha, etc.)
- How many teams typically deployed?
- Any team types? (K9, Ground, Aerial, etc.)

### 2. LPB Statistics
**Question:** Should we use:
- **Option A:** Global LPB statistics (US/international data)
- **Option B:** Ireland-specific data (if available)
- **Option C:** Start with global, refine with local data later

### 3. Subject Categories
**Question:** Are these categories sufficient for Irish SAR?
- Child (age ranges)
- Hiker
- Elderly
- Dementia
- Despondent
- Autistic
- Hunter
- Other

Any Irish-specific categories needed?

### 4. Database Timing
**Question:** For Phase 3, should we:
- **Option A:** Continue with memory layers (features lost on close, saved in QGIS project)
- **Option B:** Pause and set up PostgreSQL database first (persistent storage)

**Recommendation:** Option A for Phase 3 (faster), database in Phase 4

### 5. Search Area Status Values
**Question:** Are these status values correct for your workflow?
- Planned
- Assigned
- In Progress
- Completed
- Cleared (high POD)
- Suspended

Any changes needed?

### 6. Hazard Types
**Question:** Are these hazard types sufficient for Ireland?
- Cliff/Drop-off
- Water hazard
- **Bog/Peatland** (Ireland-specific)
- Dense vegetation
- Wildlife danger
- Weather exposure

Any additions?
